In knowledge bowl there are many other sub categories that do not come up as frequently  
as the main topics, but are still frequent enough (>1-3 a meet) to consider, and are basically  
free points if you are prepared.

Topics include:
* Famous Psychologists
* Famous Philosophers
* Religion Questions
* Music
* Much Much More....

  Each "Other" topic is centered around 1-5 very frequent answers that you can assume very early
  in the question given a key phrase or topic
  For example: Every single time the question references "The Ubermensch" or 50% of the time a question
  references a "German Philosopher" (The other 50% being Karl Marx), the answer will be Nietzsche
