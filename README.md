# The Greatest Knowledge Bowl Knowledge Base
The best practice for Knowledge Bowl is to have every person focus on one category and then one or two strong secondary categories.
Main categories are:
>* ## Science
>* ## Geography
>* ## History
>* ## Fine Arts
>* ## English/Literature

The hardest part of Knowledge Bowl is knowing what and how to study. This repository will try to address both of those problems.
A deeper look at every category:

## Science

>* ### Chemistry
>* ### Astronomy
>* ### Anatomy
>* ### Physics
>* ### Biology

Whoever focuses on Science needs to be Mr. Rozeboom's best friend. Chemistry is one of the most common flavors of science that comes up.  
They need to remember every chemist that is mentioned in junior year chem.

## Geography

>* ### Countries (all of them)
>* ### Bodies of Water
>* ### Provinces/States
>* ### Mountain Ranges
>* ### Tectonic Plates

Seterra + GeoGuessr + Wikipedia. Just spend a day learning every country. Theres only 193. Every important body of water and mountain range  
can be learned in one day.

## History

>* ### WAR
>* ### Supreme Court Cases
>* ### Birth of America
>* ### Every President.
>* ### Cold War

Honestly History is the hardest to study for. Watch many history youtube videos. Know every president. Go to **CIA** Wikipedia page and go to 'History' tab.

## Fine Arts 

>* ### Musicals
>* ### NINJA TURTLES
>* ### Paintings
