Try to work on one continent a day on [Settera](https://www.geoguessr.com/quiz/seterra).
I recommend learning the continents in this order:
> N. America -> S. America -> Europe -> Africa -> Asia -> Oceania -> The Caribbean

Once you are familiar with every country, go to their wikipedia pages and look at interesting history.
For example Burkina Faso (Western Africa) used to be named the Republic of Upper Volta.

A lot of irrelevant countries only have one "thing" that is always referenced when the question is talking about that country.
For example every single time the answer is Madagascar the question will mention Baobab trees.

Common Questions:
* How many different timezones does Russia go through
* How many countries border China
* Name any 2 of the countries that border X
